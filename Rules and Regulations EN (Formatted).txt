• AFL Alliance – Rules and Regulations

• No spamming in any form (text, emoji, tagging, etc.).

• Political and religious discussions are strictly prohibited.

• Do not share personal information (real names, locations, photos, etc.).

• Use appropriate channels for different topics. Keep discussions relevant to the channel.

• Do not advertise other servers, alliances, or services unless permitted by leadership.

• Voice chats must be used respectfully — no mic spamming, loud background noise, or interrupting others.


============================================================

-- In-Game Rules – Member Related :

============================================================


• No begging for Kamas, items, or gear.

• Crafting and magging services are not free unless the member chooses to offer them freely.

• Do not share screenshots of the AFL Discord server. All content and conversations are confidential.

============================================================

-- In-Game Rules – Perceptor Related:

============================================================


• First-to-defend policy: Only members from the attacked guild may defend first. Others should check if help is needed before joining to avoid sabotaging or interfering with the guild's defense.

• Perco spell knowledge: If you're unfamiliar with Perceptor mechanics or spells, do not join first. Learn the basics before participating.

• Perco defense is vital: Negligence in defending can result in penalties, such as reducing the number of Perceptors your guild is allowed to place.


============================================================

-- In-Game Rules – AvA Related:

============================================================


• AvA is the core of this alliance — the AFL Alliance is built primarily for AvA activities.

• AvA is where PvM, PvP, and low-level players can unite and support each other. It benefits everyone, especially PvM players who rely on prism areas for bonuses.

• Prisms must always be defended — no exceptions. During an AvA battle, everyone currently online is expected to stop whatever they are doing and join the fight.

• Participation in AvA is mandatory. If you’re online and ignore AvA calls, disciplinary action may be taken.

• Guild leaders are responsible for ensuring their members participate and follow AvA rules.


Understanding AvA mechanics is mandatory for all members, including:

• Healer/Understacking/map Holders/Fighters

• A complete AvA guide will be shared on the Discord to help members learn strategies and fulfill their roles effectively.

• Non-cooperation or repeated absence during AvA events may result in removal from the alliance.
